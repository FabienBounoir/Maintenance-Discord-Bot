# Maintenance Discord Bot

When Discord bots are updated, users are not informed directly. To remedy this, I've created a Discord bot that anyone can launch when they want to update their bot. This immediately informs users that the bot is unavailable. You can configure the maintenance message directly, and the bot is multilingual, so you can communicate properly with any community.



## Installation

Install project with npm

```bash
  npm install
  npm run start
```
    


## Environment Variables

To run this project, you will need to add the following environment variables to your .env file

`API_KEY`

`ANOTHER_API_KEY`
